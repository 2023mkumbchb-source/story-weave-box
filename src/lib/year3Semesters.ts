// Static Year 3 subunit -> semester lookup, confirmed against the MKU course
// outline. Every real unit is mapped — Chemical Pathology, Hematopathology,
// and Basic Pharmacology were split into semester-specific subunits (I/II/III)
// by reading actual article content, since those course names span more than
// one semester under a single label in the raw data.
// Only non-course documents (exam timetables, department admin docs) are
// deliberately left unmapped — they get a separate "Reference" link instead
// of a fake semester.
